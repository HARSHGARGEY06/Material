        <i> GWALIOR  is a major city in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh; it lies in northern 
          part of Madhya Pradesh and is one of the Counter-magnet cities. Located 343 kilometres (213 mi)
           south of Delhi, the capital city of India, 120 kilometres (75 mi) from Agra and 414 kilometres 
           (257 mi) from Bhopal, the state capital, Gwalior occupies a strategic location in the Gird region
            of India. The historic city and its fortress have been ruled by several historic Indian kingdoms.
             From the Kachchhapaghatas in the 10th century, Tomars in the 13th century, it was passed on to 
             the Mughal Empire, then to the Maratha in 1754, and the Scindia Dynasty of Maratha Empire in 
             the 18th century.In April 2021, It was found that Gwalior had the best air quality index 
             (AQI 152) amongst the 4 major cities in Madhya Pradesh.<br>

          Besides being the administrative headquarters of Gwalior district and Gwalior division, Gwalior has
           many administrative offices of the Chambal division of northern Madhya Pradesh. Several administrative
            and judicial organisations, commissions and boards have their state and national headquarters situated
             in the city.<br><br>
          
          Gwalior was the winter capital of the state of Madhya Bharat which later became a part of the larger
           state of Madhya Pradesh. Prior to Indian independence on 15 August 1947, Gwalior remained a princely
            state of the British Raj with the Scindia as the local rulers. High rocky hills surround the city 
            from all sides, on the north it just forms the border of the Ganga- Yamuna Drainage Basin.
             The city however is situated in the valley between the hills. Gwalior's metropolitan area
              includes Gwalior city centre, Morar Cantonment, Lashkar Gwalior (Lashkar Subcity), Maharaj Bada,
               Phool Bagh, and Thatipur.<br>
          
          Gwalior has been selected as one of the hundred Indian cities to be developed as a smart
           city under PM Narendra Modi's flagship Smart Cities Mission.\ </i> <br>

            Culture<br>
            <hr>
            Art and literature<br>
            Gwalior holds a major and a special position in the Indian classical music, art and literature.<br>
             Gwalior is a well acknowledged place of art, associated with historic as well as contemporary 
             evidence. In August 2005 a mural created by Aasutosh Panigrahi and five other artists was acknowledged
              as the World's Largest Indoor Mural by Guinness World Records. Marathi Sahitya Sammelan,
               the conference on Marathi Literature was held in Gwalior in 1961. It was presided over by writer
                Kusumavati Deshpande (herself a poet and also the wife of Kavi Anil). She was the first female
                 president of the annual Sammelan since its inception in 1878. Culturally Gwalior is the confluence
                  of two rich cultures Bundeli and Braj.<br><br>
            Music <br>
            Gwalior holds a major position in the Indian classical music, with being the birthplace of the oldest
             Hindustani sangeet gharana – Gwalior Gharana. Gwalior holds an unparalleled reputation in Sangeet and has
              retained Indian traditions and the wealth of music intact over the years. The Gwalior Gharana is not only 
              the oldest Khyal Gharana but it is also one of the most prominent gharana being the one to which most 
              classical Indian musicians can trace the origin of their style. The rise of the Gwalior Gharana started 
              with the reign of the great Mughal emperor Akbar (1542–1605). Akbar's favourite singer was Tansen, who
               came from the Gwalior area and whose ashes were buried in Gwalior after his death.

                Economy <br>
                <hr>
                Gwalior is surrounded by three industrial areas – Sitholi, Banmore and Malanpur. All three of these sectors
                 are on NH 75, NH-3 and NH 92 respectively, with Malanpur being the largest. The city once had large
                  manufacturing industries, such as Gwalior Grasim and J.C. MILLS of Birlanagar, but now this sector is left
                   with only one major factory – J.B.Mangharam Ltd.[citation needed] The important industries in the other 
                   sectors are dairy, chemical, manufacturing, and textiles. Handicraft and small industries are also found.
                    Gwalior is also an important historical and tourism sector of the country. Therefore, the tourism sector 
                    also puts an effect into the city's economy. Gwalior is one of the CMAs to New Delhi to dissipate the load 
                    of urbanisation from NCR (see § Future developments). Most of the population is involved with trading 
                    firms or are self-employed. Many run OMEs and SMEs with Gwalior and Agra as the local market. The city 
                    is scattered with coaching institutes and educational institutions which provide employment to a large 
                    section of city's population.<br>
