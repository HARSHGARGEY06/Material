Commands

tail command
it's pretty similar to cat, but only print last 10 lines by default, but it can
be changed by adding -n.
ex
tail -15 amar.txt

Commands

• head Command
• This one is complementary to the tail command. head outputs the
first 10 lines of a text file, but you can set any number of lines you
want to display with the -n flag:
• head long.txt
• head -n 5 long.txt

certain times.

Commands
• grep
• The grep filter searches a file for a particular pattern of characters,
and displays all lines that contain that pattern. The pattern that is
searched in the file is referred to as the regular expression (grep
stands for global search for regular expression and print out).
• grep [options] pattern [files]

Commands

• cd
• Go to the home folder
• cd
• 2. Move a level up
• cd ..
• 3. Return to the previous directory
• cd -

Commands

• cp Command
• It’s so easy to copy files and folders directly in the Linux terminal that
sometimes it can replace conventional file managers.
• cp file_to_copy.txt new_file.txt
• You can also copy entire directories by using the recursive flag:
• cp -r dir_to_copy/ new_copy_dir/
• Remember that in Linux, folders end with a forward slash (/).

Commands
• rm Command
• Now that you know how to copy files, it’ll be helpful to know how to
remove them.
• You can use the rm command to remove files and directories. Be careful
while using it, though, because it’s very difficult (yet not impossible) to
recover files deleted this way.
• rm file_to_copy.txt
• If you want to delete an empty directory, you can use the recursive (-r) flag:
• rm -r dir_to_remove/
• On the other hand, to remove a directory with content inside of it, you
need to use the force (-f) and recursive flags:
• rm -rf dir_with_content_to_remove/

Commands
• mv Command
• You use the mv command to move (or rename) files and directories through your
file system.
• To use this command, you’d type its name with the source and destination files:
• mv source_file destination_folder/
• mv command_list.txt commands/
• To utilize absolute paths, you’d use:
• mv /home/kinsta/BestMoviesOfAllTime ./
• ...where ./ is the directory you’re currently in.
• You also can use mv to rename files while keeping them in the same directory:
• mv old_file.txt new_named_file.txt

Commands

• mkdir Command
• To create folders in the shell, you use the mkdir command. Just
specify the new folder’s name, ensure it doesn’t exist, and you’re
ready to go.
• For example, to make a directory to keep all of your images, just type:
• mkdir images/
• To create subdirectories with a simple command, use the parent (-p)
flag:
• mkdir -p movies/2004/

Commands

• man Command
• Another essential Linux command is man. It displays the manual page
of any other command (as long as it has one).

• To see the manual page of the mkdir command, type:
• man mkdir

Commands
• apt, yum, pacman commands
• No matter which Linux distribution you’re using, it’s likely that you use package
managers to install, update, and remove the software you use every day.
• You can access these package managers through the command line, and you’d
use one or another depending on the distro your machine is running.
• The following examples will install GIMP, a free and open source software usually
available in most package managers:
• 1. Debian-based (Ubuntu, Linux Mint)
• sudo apt install gimp
• 2. Red Hat-based (Fedora, CentOS)
• sudo yum install gimp
• 3. Arch-based (Manjaro, Arco Linux)
• sudo pacman -S gimp

Commands

• ps Command
• With ps, you can take a look at the processes your current shell
session is running. It prints useful information about the programs
you’re running, like process ID, TTY (TeleTYpewriter), time, and
command name.

• ps

Commands

• kill Command
• It’s annoying when a program is unresponsive, and you can’t close it
by any means. Fortunately, the kill command solves this kind of
problem.
• Simply put, kill sends a TERM or kill signal to a process that
terminates it.
• You can kill processes by entering either the PID (processes ID) or the
program’s binary name:
• kill 533494
• kill firefox

Commands

• ping Command
• ping is the most popular networking terminal utility used to test
network connectivity. ping has a ton of options, but in most cases,
you’ll use it to request a domain or IP address:

• ping google.com

• ping 8.8.8.8

Commands

• passwd Command
• passwd allows you to change the passwords of user accounts. First, it
prompts you to enter your current password, then asks you for a new
password and confirmation.

• It’s similar to any other change of password you’ve seen elsewhere,
but in this case, it’s directly in your terminal:

• passwd

Commands
• which Command
• The which command outputs the full path of shell commands. If it can’t recognize
the given command, it’ll throw an error.
• For example, we can use this to check the binary path for Python and the Brave
web browser:
• which python
• # /usr/bin/python
• which brave
• # /usr/bin/brave

Commands

• whoami Command
• The whoami command (short for “who am i”) displays the username
currently in use:
• whoami

• You would get the same result by using echo and the environmental
variable $USER:
• echo $USER

Commands

• whatis Command
• whatis prints a single-line description of any other command, making
it a helpful reference:
• whatis python
• # python (1) - an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming
language
• whatis whatis
• # whatis (1) - display one-line manual page descriptions

Commands

• wc Command
• Wc stands for “word count,” and as the name suggests, it returns the
number of words in a text file:

• wc long.txt

• # 37 207 1000 long.txt

Commands

• uname Command
• uname(short for “Unix name”) prints the operative system
information, which comes in handy when you know your current
Linux version.
• Most of the time, you’ll be using the -a (–all) flag, since the default
output isn’t that useful:
• uname
• # Linux
• uname -a
• # Linux kinstamanjaro 5.4.138-1-MANJARO #1 SMP PREEMPT Thu Aug 5 12:15:21 UTC 20

Commands

• neofetch Command
• Neofetch is a CLI (command-line interface) tool that displays
information about your system — like kernel version, shell, and
hardware — next to an ASCII logo of your Linux distro:

Commands
• find Command
• The find command searches for files in a directory hierarchy based on a regex
expression. To use it, follow the syntax below:
• find [flags] [path] -name [expression]
• To search for a file named long.txt in the current directory, enter this:
• find ./ -name "long.txt" # ./long.txt
• To search for files that end with a .py (Python) extension, you can use the
following command:
• find ./ -type f -name "*.py" ./get_keys.py ./github_automation.py ./binarysearch
